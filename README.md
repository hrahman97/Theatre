# sample_site_1

This is a class project for CIS 5800, where the promt was to automate a theatre's ticket system. 
Each page was individually designed and went through revision to meet stakeholder's requirements. 
Along with designing and coding the website, the progress was tracked through the role of a project manager, which I took on. 

Finished website - https://hrahman97.github.io/Theatre/
