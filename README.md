# Theatre

This is a class project for CIS 5800, where the prompt was to automate a theatre's ticketing system. Each page was individually designed to provide simplicity for end-users and went through revisions to meet stakeholder's requirements. Along with designing and coding the website, I tracked the progress of the project as the project manager.

Finished website - https://hrahman97.github.io/Theatre/
